# Volkswagen ID4 Camping Mode
Upgrade for Volkswagen ID.4: camping mode / dog mode

## Problem

The ID.4 does not have a camping or dog mode, which allows you to leave the climate control on for an extended period of time.  The system turns itself off after 30 minutes.

## Other solutions:

Many have found work-around solutions, with several internet forum posts ([vwforum](https://www.vwidtalk.com/threads/the-current-state-of-camping-mode-hacks.15066/)
* Use the App, every 30 minutes, and turn on the climate.  Drawbacks: need to remember to do it every 30 minutes, and need to be in cell phone range.  Generally impractical.
* 35 lbs Kettle Bell and seat belt fastened. Drawbacks: heavy, expensive, potential for leaving divots in the seat, safety concerns with driving with a heavy object that could become a projectile.
* Seat sensor spoofer device. Drawbacks: challenging installation, potential or perceived risks with warrantee or other unexpected failures, expensive.
* Use the cabin pre-heating scheduling function. Drawbacks: will only warm up the car on those specific times, the temperature will not be constant over time, limited number of scheduling slots.
* Use an app to modify the 30 minute timeout to 10,000 seconds (5.5 hours, maximum). [vw forum, app discussion](https://www.vwidtalk.com/threads/camping-mode-unlocked.16634/?post_id=290138&nested_view=1&sortby=oldest#post-290138)

## The stick solution:
* Fool the seat pressure sensor using a stick, where the pressure comes from the ceiling. Use the seat height adjuster to raise the seat and exert pressure.
* Advantages: cheaper, lighter, re-used or found materials.

### Instructions:
* Place one container on the drivers' side seat, about 6" or 15 cm forward from the back rest
* Plase the second container on top of the stick, and put in position between the ceiling and the seat
* Raise the seat until the display brings up the "Welcome xxx" screen. This is when you have achieved a sufficient pressure for the seat.
* Put on the seat belts on
* Push the brake. The car should turn on.
* Adjust the climate settings: temperature, and use fresh air (not re-circulation to avoid condensation)
* Estimate the energy requirements to ensure that you will have sufficient battery charge.  For example, 2 kW * 8 hours = 16 kWh, which is about 20% of the battery.

### Parts required:
* a stick (2x2", 2x4", anything from the forest) that is about 39" or 1 m long
* two objects such as plastic food storage containers, that are smooth on the bottom; smoothness and size are important parameters so that you do not put divots in the seat
